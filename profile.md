### User Profiles

#### Get User Profile

GET `/users/{user.id}/profile`  
Returns a [user profile object](#user-profile-object) or 404 if the user does not exist  
Note: a deleted guild can be returned in `mutual_guilds` (including the `nick` field), so do not assume all the guilds in `mutual_guilds` actually exist. The official client simply hides this information
