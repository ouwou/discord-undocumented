### Member Verification Gate and Guild Applications

Guilds with the feature `MEMBER_VERIFICATION_GATE_ENABLED` require new members to verify themselves  
Guilds may also create forms that users submit in order to apply for access to a guild  

#### Get Member Verification Gate

The official client adds parameters `with_guild=true` and `invite_code=` but these don't seem to do anything  
Returns a [verfication gate info object](#verification-gate-info-object) or 204 No Content if there is no verification gate

#### Modify Member Verification Gate

PATCH `/guilds/{guild.id}/member-verification`  
Request body is a partial [verfication gate info object](#verification-gate-info-object)  
Returns a [verfication gate info object](#verification-gate-info-object)
